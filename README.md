# ⚙️ Embedded & Firmware Study Vault by Yoi

Welcome to my study vault dedicated to embedded systems and firmware development.  
This repository organizes key topics I’ve studied with explanations, code examples, and reference notes.  
Each folder covers a specific domain or subject area.

## ✅ How to Use

Each topic is linked to its own `.md` file or folder with:
- Concept overview
- Code examples (C/C++)
- Edge case notes
- Interview caveats or common mistakes
