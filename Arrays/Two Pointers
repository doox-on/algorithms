# ðŸ§­ Two Pointer Algorithm Summary

## ðŸ“Œ Key Concept

- **Two Pointer** is a technique where you use two indices (or pointers) to traverse a data structure, usually a **sorted array** or **string**, to solve problems efficiently in **O(n)** time.
- One pointer starts at the **beginning**, the other at the **end**, and both move toward each other based on some condition.

---

## ðŸ”§ When to Use

- The input is **sorted** (array or string)
- You're finding **pairs**, **subarrays**, or **ranges** that meet certain conditions
- You're working with **palindromes**, **duplicates**, **window sums**, etc.

## ðŸ“ˆ Time Complexity

- Typically **O(n)** for linear scan
- Often more efficient than brute force (**O(nÂ²)**)

## ðŸ§ª Common Variants

| Variant | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| Start-End | `left = 0, right = n - 1` â†’ for sum-based problems |
| Forward-Forward | `i = 0, j = 0` â†’ for sliding window problems |
| Bidirectional | Matching from both ends (e.g., palindrome checks) |
